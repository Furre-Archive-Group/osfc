Open Source Furcadia Implementation
===================================

A open source implementation of Furcadia.

## Why?
There are various reasons:
* In the event Furcadia ever disappears(which I hope it doesn't!), I want a way to preserve it accurately.
* A legal way to access the archival server.
* As a programming exercise.
* A alternative cross-platform client to use instead of running it on wine on linux.

## Encryption
While we do have a encryption implementation, it is not going to be made publicly 
avaliable. The reason for this is:
1. Users may use this code to decrypt existing maps on the official server.
2. It may encourage "free" private servers.

Use of encryption is still possible in **OFFICIAL** builds, but will be replaced 
with dummy code in the source.

If access to encryption code is needed, you will be required to sign a NDA and 
provide a reasonable explaination on why such access is needed.
